I started working on this project precisely at 3:13 pm on August 4, 2023 (WAT). It took me 6 minutes and 8 seconds to complete the installation of the necessary packages. After that, I proceeded with the setup of Redux and screen routes, which took 49 minutes and 52 seconds.

Around 4:11 pm (WAT), I began the process of creating screens and connecting the APIs, which ended up taking approximately 7 hours, 50 minutes, and 23 seconds.

The entire project was completed within a span of 9 hours, with the final completion time being at 12:02 am on August 5, 2023 (WAT).
